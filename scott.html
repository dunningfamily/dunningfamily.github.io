        <p>Welcome to Scott's page. Here you can read about some of his interests and hobbies, as well as some goofy stuff about him, and probably some boring stuff, too; However, he worked hard to make this, so READ IT ANYWAY!</p>

            <h3><span style = "color : #18bc9c">Austin Peay State University</span></h3></center>
            <p>Scott is currently a senior at APSU and is achieveing a Bachelor's Degree with a major in Computer Science, a Computer Science concentration, and minors in Mobile Software Development and Mathematics.</p>

          <h3><span style = "color : #18bc9c">A little about Scott...</span></h3>
          <p>Scott is currently furthering his knowledge and experience as an Android Programmer for the <a href = "http://gisweb.apsu.edu" target = " _blank"><span style = "color: #e74c3c">GIS Center</span></a> at APSU. He currently has a few apps on the <a href = "https://play.google.com/store" target = " _blank"><span style = "color: #e74c3c">Google Play Store</span></a>, including some he developed himself. He has also added some work to previously constructed apps which included design and functionality.</p>
          <br/>
          <p>Scott was also enlisted in the <a href = "http://www.af.mil" target = " _blank"><span style = "color: #3498db">United States Air Force</span></a> from 2001 to 2005 and achieved the rank of Senior Airman. He was an Electrical Power Production Journeyman, MOS 3E052. Like all Airmen, he went to Basic Military Training at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas, and then attended Electrical Power Production Training at Sheppard Air Force Base, Texas. He was then stationed, for the remainder of his Air Force career, at Grand Forks Air Force Base, North Dakota, where he operated, maintained, and installed electrical power production systems, or as the rest of the world calls them, generators. He also spent some time as an augmented Security Forces Officer.</p>
          <br/>
          <p>Scott has had many other work experiences, including being a Correctional Officer for the state of Tennessee at Riverbend Maximum Security Institute; However, his ideal job would be to eventually work for an Android Development company, maybe one day even Google.</p>
          <br/>
          <p>Video games are a beloved passtime for Scott, as you may have guessed. His favorites include the Assassin's Creed series as well as the Batman: Arkahm franchise. He was mostly into Xbox 360 console titles, but has recently upgraded to Steam. You just can't beat a good PC for a great gaming experience, but watch out Windows, gaming is coming to Linux!</p>
          <br/>
          <p>Speaking of Linux and Unix, Scott has also made the switch to Mac OSX as his main computing platform, especially for work and production as it is incredibly more efficient than Windows, though he still uses Windows for gaming and entertainment as he is sadly forced to do. Though he uses Mac, made by Apple, he is still an avid Android user as well, and WILL NOT be making the switch to iPhone, due mostly to his preference for developing on Android.</p>
